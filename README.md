# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning and neural network to accurately optimize funding to applicants based on predicted success.

## RESULTS
- the target variable is IS_SUCCESSFUL
- the removed columns were EIN and NAME.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- The original attempt considered 100 and 50 neurons in 2 layers as a starting point. 
- The desired accuracy was not achieved, and as a result some of the optimzation attempts included increasing the neurons as well as the levels.
- Eventually, the highest accuracy level obtained was 73%.

## SUMMARY

Pre-optimization, an accuracy of 72.7% was achieved. Post optimization, an accuracy of 73.1% was achieved. a 75% accuracy was not achieved. Various attemps were made to bring the accuracy to 75%, including changing to 1000 epochs, increasing the numbers of neurons, and increasing the number of layers. None of these helped bring the accuracy to 75%.
